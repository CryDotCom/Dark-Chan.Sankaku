Here are all changes starting from 1.0.3.4

v. 1.1.0.0 : Changes to Imagelogo part of the script:
              Removed the big script for changing the Logo on pageload.
              Added abit of css code to change the Url of the Logo Image.
              Logo nolonger flashes its old version with white background.

v. 1.0.5.0 : Added @run-at document-Start and modified script that it loads with it. 
             Script now loads before the page is loaded, which removes the "Flashing" of the old white Background on load of page.
             
             Added the Header Thumb images/links into the CSS code for removal. 
             they now won't flash/appear for a split second anymore aswell.
             this removed the script function for doing this, now the script has to work less.
            
             ToDo: make logo load before page finishes loading the old logo, so it does not flash anymore aswell.

v. 1.0.4.0 : uploaded all images to Github and added the new images to the script.

V. 1.0.3.5 : Fixed header logo (to the new one from mainpage)
